Frequently asked questions
=====

What is the Ajna Protocol? 
------------

The Ajna protocol is a noncustodial, peer-to-peer, permissionless lending,
borrowing and trading system implemented for the Ethereum Virtual Machine
that requires no governance or external price feeds to function.

What assets can be lent and borrowed on Ajna?
----------------
The protocol consists of pools: pairings of quote tokens provided
by lenders and collateral tokens provided by borrowers. 
Ajna is capable of accepting fungible tokens (ERC-20) as quote tokens and fungible 
(ERC-20) as well as non-fungible (ERC-721 and ERC-1155) tokens as collateral tokens.


What chains are you going to deploy on and do you have any plans for deployment on an Ethereum L2?
----------------
The protocol is written to work on any EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible 
chain. The first launch will be on the Ethereum Mainnet chain with secondary launches 
to be on Polygon, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain, and Optimism.


When do you expect to deploy to a production chain?
----------------
Early 2023


Where is and when will the white paper be ready for public consumption?
----------------
Our white paper will be available on `ajna.finance <https://ajna.finance/>`_ sometime early 2023


How can I get involved?
----------------
At this time, the best way to get involved is to learn and educate. Engage in discord discussions, 
answer questions, and create content / memes!


Is Ajna custodial?
----------------
No Ajna is entirely non custodial, user’s are in charge of their private keys at all times.


Has Ajna been audited?
----------------
Ajna is scheduled to be audited by; Trail of Bits and Sherlock.


Does Ajna have a bug bounty?
----------------

Where can I get information about Ajna?
----------------
Check out our website at  www.ajna.finance and join our Discord!

Where can I test the application? Will there be an Alpha version of the protocol?
----------------
When released there will be testnet and mainnet versions. Links will be posted on `ajna.finance <https://ajna.finance/>`_

What are price Oracles? Why is it such a big deal that they are excluded in Ajna’s design?
----------------
Oracles are outside services that provide prices for different assets. Since they are external 
to the system they can be manipulated. Ajna uses an internal order book to determine asset values 
from the lenders. This makes the protocol not susceptible to outside oracle price manipulation attacks.

Where is the Github code?
----------------
When available the code will be available on our github

Where are the contract addresses for each chain?
----------------
When deployed a link will be available on `ajna.finance <https://ajna.finance/>`_
